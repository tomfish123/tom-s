# AutoEncoder-Based-Communication-System

Implementation and result of AutoEncoder Based Communication System From Research Paper : "An Introduction to Deep Learning for the Physical Layer" http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8054694/

This Repo is effictively implementation of AutoEncoder based Communication System From Research Paper "An Introduction to Deep Learning
for the Physical Layer" written by Tim O'Shea and Jakob Hoydis.During My wireless Communication Lab Course,I worked on this research Paper
and re-generated result of this research Paper.
Idea of Deep learning Based Communication System is new and there is many advantages of Deep learning based Communication.This paper gives 
complete different apporach than many other paper and tries to introduce deep learning in physical layer.

# Abstract of Research Paper

*We present and discuss several novel applications of deep learning for the physical layer. By interpreting a communications system as an
autoencoder, we develop a fundamental new way to think about communications system design as an end-to-end reconstruction task that seeks
to jointly optimize transmitter and receiver components in a single process. We show how this idea can be extended to networks of multiple
transmitters and receivers and present the concept of radio transformer networks as a means to incorporate expert domain knowledge in the
machine learning model. Lastly, we demonstrate the application of convolutional neural networks on raw IQ samples for modulation
classification which achieves competitive accuracy with respect to traditional schemes relying on expert features. This paper is concluded
with a discussion of open challenges and areas for future investigation.*

# Requirements

- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

# Note 
Given Jupyter-Notebook file is dynamic to train any given (n,k) autoencodeer but for getting optimal result one has to manually tweak
learning rate and epochs.
Plots are generated by matlab script which for now i am not providing it.Anyone can plot result in matlab by training autoencoder and
copy-pasting BER array and ploting it into matlab.
All re-generated result  below are generated with autoencoder_dynamic.ipynb file.
